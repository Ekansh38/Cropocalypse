## Description

Cook or be cooked.

In this chaotic top-down survival game, hostile vegetables sprout around you. A soldier like you decides to survive off of the flesh of fellow plants... All while making bank. 

Murder your ingredients in cold blood and combine them to craft dishes that restore health, thirst, or sell your dishes to a mysterious pigeon (which is also an arms dealer?) and save money to purchase powerful weapons. Do so while blasting bok choy with your trusty arsenal of weapons!

The theme “Compound” is at the core: you combine (compound) ingredients into dishes to survive. Strategic cooking becomes just as important as combat.

This game was made with team of 2 in 72 hours for Melon Jam 6.

We hope you enjoy it!
